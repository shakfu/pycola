## Performance Hotspots

### 1. Gradient Descent - `compute_derivatives()` (descent.py:176)

**Current Implementation**:
```python
def compute_derivatives(self, x: np.ndarray) -> None:
    """Compute first and second derivatives."""
    # Nested loops: O(n²)
    for u in range(n):
        for v in range(n):
            if u == v:
                continue

            # Distance computation
            for i in range(self.k):
                dx = x[i, u] - x[i, v]  # Per-dimension
                d[i] = dx
                d2[i] = dx * dx
                distance_squared += d2[i]

            distance = math.sqrt(distance_squared)  # Called n² times

            # ... more computation per pair
```

**Issues**:
- **O(n²) complexity**: For n=500, that's 250,000 node pair iterations
- **Per-dimension loops**: Extra k loops inside n² loop
- **Repeated math calls**: `sqrt` and `isfinite` called in innermost loops
- **Scalar operations**: Not vectorized despite using NumPy

**Impact**:
- Medium graph (100 nodes): 10,000 pairs × 136 iterations = 1,360,000 pair computations
- Large graph (500 nodes): 250,000 pairs × ~150 iterations = 37,500,000 pair computations

### 2. Shortest Paths - Dijkstra (shortestpaths.py:176)

**Current Implementation**:
- Pure Python Dijkstra with pairing heap priority queue
- O(E log V) per source node, O(V × E log V) total for all-pairs

**Impact**:
- Medium graph: 0.158s (4% of total)
- Large graph: 10.5s (9% of total)
- Becomes significant only for larger graphs

### 3. Priority Queue Operations (pqueue.py)

**Current Implementation**:
- Pairing heap in pure Python
- Used heavily by Dijkstra's algorithm

**Impact**:
- Medium graph: ~0.15s across merge/remove_min/pop operations
- Not a major bottleneck compared to gradient descent

## Optimization Recommendations

### ✅ Priority 1: Vectorize `compute_derivatives` (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED**

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
def compute_derivatives(self, x: np.ndarray) -> None:
    """Vectorized derivative computation using NumPy broadcasting."""
    n = self.n
    if n < 1:
        return

    # Compute all pairwise differences using broadcasting
    diff = x[:, :, np.newaxis] - x[:, np.newaxis, :]  # (k, n, n)
    diff_squared = diff ** 2
    dist_squared = np.sum(diff_squared, axis=0)  # (n, n)

    # Create masks for edge cases
    diagonal_mask = np.eye(n, dtype=bool)
    distances = np.sqrt(np.maximum(dist_squared, 1e-9))

    # Vectorized weight and validity checking
    weights = self.G.copy() if self.G is not None else np.ones((n, n))
    p_stress_mask = (weights > 1) & (distances > self.D)
    weights = np.where(weights > 1, 1.0, weights)
    valid_mask = ~diagonal_mask & np.isfinite(self.D) & ~p_stress_mask

    # Vectorized gradient and Hessian computation
    # ... (full implementation in descent.py)
```

**Actual Results**:
- ✅ Small graphs: **38x faster** for `compute_derivatives`, **65x overall**
- ✅ Medium graphs: **110x faster** for `compute_derivatives`, **20x overall**
- ✅ Large graphs: **166x faster** for `compute_derivatives`, **21x overall**
- ✅ All 312 tests pass - numerical correctness maintained

**Challenges Solved**:
- ✅ Grid snap forces handled correctly
- ✅ Lock constraints work as before
- ✅ Diagonal elements properly masked
- ✅ Division by zero prevented with `np.where`
- ✅ P-stress filtering maintained

### Priority 2: Cache Distance Matrix (Medium Impact)

**Status**: ⏸️ **DEFERRED** - Not needed after vectorization

**Reason**: With vectorization, distance computation is no longer the bottleneck. The overhead of caching and cache invalidation would likely negate any benefits.

**Original Strategy**: Compute distance matrix once, reuse across iterations

**Decision**: Focus on Dijkstra optimization instead, which is now the primary bottleneck.

### ✅ Priority 2: Optimize Shortest Paths (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Cython implementation provides 5x speedup

**Performance BEFORE Cython**:
- Medium graph (100 nodes): 0.156s (75% of 0.207s total)
- Large graph (500 nodes): 4.661s (82% of 5.651s total)

**Performance AFTER Cython**:
- Medium graph (100 nodes): 0.051s total (4x faster than vectorization alone)
- Large graph (500 nodes): 1.104s total (5x faster than vectorization alone)

**Implementation**: Priority cascade (Cython → scipy → pure Python)
1. **Cython-compiled Dijkstra** - Compiles priority queue and shortest paths to C
2. **scipy fallback** - Available with `pip install pycola[fast]`
3. **Pure Python fallback** - Always available

**Achieved Speedup**: 4-5x on top of vectorization
- Combined speedup: **80-105x** compared to original v0.1.0

**Impact**: Large graphs (500 nodes) now complete in **~1 second** instead of 115.8s (original).

### Priority 3: Use Numba JIT Compilation (Low Priority)

**Status**: ⏸️ **NOT NEEDED** - Current performance is excellent

**Rationale**: After Cython optimization, Numba provides minimal benefit:
- Current performance: 500-node graphs in ~1s (was 115s)
- Cython already provides C-level performance
- Numba would add ~2-3x at most (1.1s → 0.4s)
- Adds runtime dependency and JIT overhead
- Diminishing returns - not worth the complexity

**When to revisit**:
- If profiling reveals new Python bottlenecks after Cython
- If users need <100ms latency for large graphs
- If algorithmic improvements aren't sufficient

**Current recommendation**: ❌ **Skip** - Performance is production-ready

### Priority 4: Parallel Processing (Future Enhancement)

**Status**: ⏭️ **FUTURE** - Evaluate after scipy optimization

**Strategy**: Parallelize remaining computations

**Options**:
1. **NumPy with BLAS threading** - Already used for vectorized operations
2. **numba.prange** - For any remaining Python loops
3. **Parallel Dijkstra** - Multiple sources computed simultaneously

**Expected Speedup**: 2-4x on multi-core (diminishing returns after vectorization)

**Note**: With current vectorization + scipy, most graphs will complete in <1s, making parallelization less critical.

## Optimization Priority Matrix

### Original (Pre-Vectorization)
| Optimization | Impact | Effort | Priority | Expected Speedup |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Vectorize compute_derivatives | Very High | High | **1** | 10-50x |
| Numba JIT compilation | High | Low | **2** | 5-20x |
| Parallel processing | Medium | Medium | **3** | 4-8x |
| Cache distance matrix | Medium | Low | **4** | 2x |
| scipy shortest paths | Low | Low | **5** | 3-5x |

### Final (Post-Cython)
| Optimization | Impact | Effort | Priority | Status | Actual Speedup |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Vectorize compute_derivatives | Very High | High | **1** | ✅ **DONE** | **20-170x** |
| Cython shortest paths | High | Medium | **2** | ✅ **DONE** | **4-5x** |
| Algorithmic improvements | Medium | High | **3** | ⏸️ Not needed | 2-5x potential |
| Numba JIT | Low | Low | **-** | ⏸️ Not needed | ~2x potential |
| Parallel processing | Low | Medium | **-** | ⏸️ Not needed | ~2-4x potential |
| Cache distance matrix | Low | Low | **-** | ⏸️ Not needed | N/A |

**Overall Achievement**: **80-105x speedup** - Performance is now production-ready.

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (If Needed)

**Current Status**: Performance is production-ready. Further optimization is **not a priority**.

**Potential future work** (only if specific use cases demand it):

   - Adaptive step sizes (less iteration needed)
   - Early termination heuristics
   - **Impact**: 2-5x speedup, fewer iterations

2. **Parallelization** (Low value):
   - Parallel gradient computation (OpenMP/numba.prange)
   - Multi-threaded Dijkstra (multiple sources)
   - **Impact**: 2-4x on multi-core systems
   - **Downside**: Adds complexity, GIL issues

3. **Memory optimization** (Low value):
   - Sparse matrix representation for very large graphs
   - Cache-friendly data layouts
   - **Impact**: Enables larger graphs (>10,000 nodes)

4. **GPU acceleration** (Very low priority):
   - CuPy for gradient descent
   - **Impact**: 10-100x for massive graphs (>100,000 nodes)
   - **Downside**: Requires CUDA, limited applicability

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Current performance is sufficient** for the vast majority of use cases. Only pursue further optimization if users report specific performance requirements that aren't met.
